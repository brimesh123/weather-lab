# App Icon Setup - Complete! ✅

## What Was Done
I've set up your Weather Lab logo as the **app launcher icon** (the icon that appears on the phone's home screen and app drawer).

## Configuration
- **Icon Source**: `assets/logo.png`
- **Platforms**: Android ✅ | iOS ✅
- **Adaptive Icon**: Enabled for Android 12+ with dark blue background (#0a1025)

## Files Generated
The `flutter_launcher_icons` package automatically created all required icon sizes:
- **Android**: Multiple densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- **Android 12+**: Adaptive icon with foreground and background layers
- **iOS**: All required sizes for different devices

## How to See It
1. Build and install the app: `flutter run`
2. Check your phone's home screen - you'll see the Weather Lab logo as the app icon!
3. The icon will also appear in the app drawer and recent apps screen.

## Updating the Icon
If you want to change the icon later:
1. Replace `assets/logo.png` with your new logo
2. Run: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`
3. Rebuild the app

Your app now has a professional, branded icon! 🎨
